    <h1>Experiences</h1>

    <p>I used to go to Kuben VGS and studied <em>Informatikklinja - Praksisrettet studiekompetanse med Informasjonsteknologi</em>,
        it was a great school and especialy our class was filled with talented people,
        we were a rolemodel class, even though we were the first batch of young pupil, we did not necessarily always have
    the right hardware for the job, we started creating codes from books for javascript with html and css, I learned a lot. Even though
our bad performing potato computers would crash a lot, we pulled through. We worked together, and when we were stuck in the process, we would search online or ask our colleagues.
It was one of the greatest experiences in my life, and also the best people I have met were at Kuben VGS, there were highs and lows, especially the food in the cafeteria
you would pay 30 norwegain crowns, but the sandwich would sometimes be half the size, which was hilarious at times. Not so fun, when I was really hungry.</p>

    <p>Jeg gikk på Lillestrøm VGS, <em>Medier og kommunikasjon</em>. Lillestrøm er en veldig gammel skole med en lang og ærverdig arv spesielt innen studiespesialisering og musikk.
        Da jeg begynte der begynte skolen å vise spor av den gamle alderen i form av at bygningene var for små, utdaterte eller hadde dårlig luft.
        Derfor bestemte ledelsen seg for å bygge ut, og mine tre år fikk jeg ikke bare lite plass, utdaterte bygninger og dårlig luft, men også lite uteareal.
    <br>Fine folk da.</p>
